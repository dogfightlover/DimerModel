# DimerModel
5_17
  1. plot capacity, order parameter
  2. add errorbar
  3. better defination of order parameter
  4. add binder cumulant
  5. larger lattice 
  6. KT phase transition criterion


 (Introduction) \n
  model hexagon lattice \n
  Hamilitonian: why counting star? quantum dimer model \n
  periodic boundary condition \n
  Definition of capacity: (why so in monte carlo simulation) \n
  Definition of order parameter(highlight): \n
  introduce domain \n
  three degeneracy of ground state \n
  at different ground state, three directions of order parameter \n
  
  another kind of order parameter \n
  stability of binder ratio why? \n
  
  our work: \n
  capacity  capacity-temperature curve at different size \n
  phase transition point \n
  
  what we will do next: \n
  order parameter circle/other curver in complex plane \n
